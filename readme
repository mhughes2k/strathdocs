This is a local plugin that can be used to intercept moodle docs and moodle errors so that they can be substituted / redirected
to local guidance, rather than the Mooe Core docs.

Redirecting Errors
Set the $CFG->errordocroot to $CFG-> . '/local/strathdocs/index.php';

All errors will be directed to this page. If the error module is part of Moodle core it will be passed on to the 'standard' 
moodle docs destination page (i.e. http://moodle.org/docs/en/<module>/<errorcode>

If it is not the plugin will look for a string the in the specified modules language pack in the form "<errorcode>_url".

If this string exists, then the browser will be redirected to the (expected to be a) url as set in the language pack.

Redirecting Documentation Pages

You can also redirect Moodle documentation pages (i.e. the link at the bottom of the page that says "Moodle docs for this page".

Set the $CFG->docroot to $CFG-> . '/local/strathdocs/index.php';

By default this link goes to something like "http://docs.moodle.org/36/en/course/view/topics"
36 - Moodle Version Number
en - Language
course - module
view/topics - a "thing"

Again for non-standard plugins if the language string "<thing>_url" exists, the browser will be redirected to that location.
